This project is archived, as Java Webstart was discontinued and later BBj versions implement this functionality internally.

----------------

This plugin allows you to package the BBj ThinClient with Java, so that you can deploy it to a client computer running Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux. It allows you to specify and add any JAR files that are needed in the client. By doing so, the client system does not require any Java to be pre-installed, and your BBj client will run with the JDK that you have selected and packaged.

This plugin must be executed on a computer that has the JDK to be added to the package. It connects to BBjServices via the AdminAPI, allowing you to select a JNLP application managed by the Enterprise Manager. 

It supports Oracle JDK 8 and JRE 8 versions and, beginning with Version 1.6, Oracle JDK 11 and OpenJDK 11.
